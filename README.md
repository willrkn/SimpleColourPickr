# SimpleColourPickr
 A simple colour picker that recommends complimentary colours.

# Description
This is an idea I had when using free online colour pickers for Windows during webdev and they all sucked. The aim of this is to create a small program that can determine the rgb value under the cursor, and also recommend common complimentary colours and colours that go with it.
